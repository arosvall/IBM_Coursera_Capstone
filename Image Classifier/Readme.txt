This code and report were used for a third-year Computer Science course Machine Learning Tools and Techniques as the final project.
The aim of the project was to take in images of three fruits - strawberries, tomatoes and cherries - and to be able to accurately label an unseen instance as one of the three fruits.
This project used a deep learning neural network in order to classify these images.
The accompanying report details the steps taken within this project, and justification for those steps.
Within the code there are references to test.py. This was a file supplied by the university which was used for testing the neural network on unseen data. Much of it was adapted into the notebook which trained the DNN.
This project was completed over four weeks, and was in place of a final exam for this topic.
This project achieved a grade of A-, working towards the overall A grade of the paper
