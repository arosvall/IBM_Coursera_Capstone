This was the fourth assignment in Machine Learning Tools and Techniques that covered Exploratory Data Analysis, Regression and Classification
The notebooks contained in this folder either looked at ten different models of classification or regression, running the data through each model to get an appropriate loss function (accuracy for classification and MSE for regression for example)
The motivation of this assignment was to become comfortable with the Scikit learn python modules and to analyse differences in models and to understand what caused these differences
The reports in this section detailed the EDA undertaken, along with the difference analysis on the different models.

This assignment was given over a three week period
This assignment achieved an A+ grade
